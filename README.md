# Discord RAG Knowledge Base

Boldly going where hundreds have gone before.

This bot contains
- a vectorstore that texts can be saved, loaded, cleared, and have texts added to it.
- support for either printing the vectorstore's raw messages, or passing them to an AI to stitch the messages into a (hopefully-)coherent answer.
- optional caching for exact and similar queries, that can also be saved/loaded/cleared if desired.
- an optional global cooldown.
- the ability for elevated users to request existing messages be added to the vectorstore, pending the original author's approval.
- the ability to block/unblock specific users from interacting with the bot.
- the ability to trust/distrust specific users with elevated commands.
- the ability for users to <u>voluntarily</u> waive/reinvoke the need to ask for their approval prior to adding their messages to the vectorstore.
- the ability to save/load/clear pending vectorstore addition requests and pending waivers.
<!-- - the theoretical ability to return messages in other languages, should anyone be [willing to add translations](src/translations.py). -->

## Installation and Setup
1. Visit [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a bot, and enable Message Content Intent for it. When invited to servers, the bot must have `Send message`, `Read message history`, and `Manage reactions` permissions. Copy and save its bot token.
2. *Optional: Visit [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) and create an API key.*
3. Install [Python 3.10 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads) alongside its pip package manager.
4. Clone or download+extract this repository.
5. Open a terminal of your choice and install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r "[your/path/to/]requirements.txt" -U
```
6. Open [Settings.py](Settings.py) in your editor of choice, and adjust the bot's settings as desired. You can also alter some of the bot's printed messages in [Translations.py](Translations.py) if desired.
7. Launch the bot. If no Groq API key is provided, the bot will solely print the most relevant messages from the vectorstore when queried.
```bash
py "[your/path/to/]Main.py" "[Discord bot token]" "[Groq API key (optional)]"
```

## Commands
This bot is primarily interacted with via slash commands or pinging it.
- `[/ask or ping the bot] [query]`: Looks up and generates an answer for the provided query.
- `/help [command (optional)]`: Prints the bot's purpose and list of commands, or a single command if one is specified.
- `/ping`: Returns the bot's latency.
- `[ping the bot] permit`: Adds oneself to the permitting group, allowing trusted users to add any of their messages to the vectorstore without having to individually request permission.
- `/revoke`: Removes oneself from the permitting group, revoking the permission to trusted users granted by `permit`.
- `/getsize [Blocked Group|Cache|Permitting Group|Permitting Requests|Trusted Group|Vectorstore|Vectorstore Requests]`: Returns the number of entries in the provided group/cache/requests list/vectorstore.
- `/contains [Blocked Group|Permitting Group|Trusted Group] [user ID (optional)]`: Returns whether the provided group contains the command executor, or the provided user if one is specified.
### Trusted commands
- `/add [Blocked Group|Trusted Group|Vectorstore] [user ID/message URL]`: Directly adds the provided user ID, to the provided group, or *requests to* add the linked message to the provided vectorstore.
- `/clear [All|Blocked Group|Cache|Permitting Group|Permitting Requests|Trusted Group|Vectorstore Requests]`: Clears the provided group/cache/requests list/vectorstore, respectively.
- `/remove [Blocked Group|Trusted Group] [user ID]`: Removes the provided user from the provided group.
### Owner commands
- `/save [All|Blocked Group|Cache|Permitting Group|Permitting Requests|Trusted Group|Vectorstore|Vectorstore Requests] [filepath (optional)]`: Saves the provided group/cache/requests list/vectorstore to their last-used filepath, or the provided filepath if specified.
- `/load [All|Blocked Group|Cache|Permitting Group|Permitting Requests|Trusted Group|Vectorstore|Vectorstore Requests] [filepath (optional)]`: Loads the provided group/cache/requests list/vectorstore from their last-used filepath, or the provided filepath if specified.

### Reactions
For messages sent after the bot is added, trusted users can request to add an existing message to the vectorstore by adding the `DISCORD_REQUEST_ADDITION_EMOJI` reaction specified in [Settings.py](Settings.py). This requires the original author's approval unless the requester *is* the original author, or the author has voluntarily added himself/herself to the permitting group.

A current limitation is that the bot cannot detect reactions on messages sent prior to the bot last coming online. For those messages, use `/add Vectorstore [URL]` instead.

## Acknowledgments
For the original code of this bot, much of it was adapted from a similar project I had worked on alongside six other people. All rights to unmodified corresponding pieces of code belong to their original authors. However, the code has also been substantially expanded since then.
